# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name: Community-Driven Local Issues Tracker

*(Working title – can be renamed later)*

---

## 1. Purpose & Vision

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Local infrastructure issues such as potholes, water leaks, power outages, and garbage accumulation often go unreported or unresolved due to:

A **community-driven digital platform** where citizens can:

* Report local issues with images and location
* Track status updates transparently
* Engage with local authorities through a structured workflow
